# Automated Data Synchronization

---

## Overview

The Automated Data Synchronization project aims to create a comprehensive system for handling both real-time and batch
data processing. This system will facilitate the seamless synchronization of data from various sources, ensuring
accurate and efficient storage in long-term databases for future analysis. Key features include real-time data
synchronization and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processing.

## My plan

1. First, I will analyze the tasks for the automated data synchronization project.
    - INPUT: I expect to receive not only CSV files containing data rows or records, but also real-time data that is
      continuously generated by a system, possibly a large one. In my project, I refer to this as the "
      mini_data_generator," which serves as a sample system to demonstrate the workings of an overall system. I have
      defined the types and structures of the generated data
      inside [the readme.md file of that generator](./mini_data_generator/readme.md).
    - OUTPUT: The primary purpose of this project is to store data in long-term databases for real-time and future
      analysis. Additionally, I also intend to include the task of manipulating this data in the project's to-do list.
    - PROCESS: I am aiming to develop a system with the following features:
        - `Real-time data synchronization`
        - `ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processing`
        - `Data quality and monitoring`
        - `Data schema evolution`
        - `Scalability and fault tolerance`
        - `Batch and streaming integration`
        - Additionally, I plan to incorporate features for `data visualization and reporting`, as well as
          `security and compliance`.
2. The technology stacks used in this project.
    - Data generator: JavaFaker library & Apache NiFi
    - Ingestion: Apache NiFi
    - Validation: Apache Avro
    - Real-time Processing: Apache Kafka & Spark
    - Batch Processing: Apache Spark
    - Storage and Analysis: Apache Cassandra & Elasticsearch

## Project Use Cases

### Data Querying and Analysis

- Retrieve and analyze stored data to generate insights and support decision-making.
- Users query data from Apache Cassandra and Elasticsearch to perform various types of analysis. Queries can be for
  trends, patterns, or specific information. Results are used for business intelligence, reporting, and strategic
  planning.

### Data Visualization

- Create visual representations of data to make it easier to understand and interpret.
- Automated or manual reports are generated using reporting tools. Reports include summaries, detailed analyses, and
  visualizations of the data. Dashboards provide real-time updates on important metrics and performance indicators.

### Data Archiving and Retention

- Manage the long-term storage and archival of historical data.
- Data is periodically archived from active storage systems to long-term archival storage. Archival policies ensure data
  is retained according to regulatory requirements and organizational needs.

### Data Enrichment

- Enhance stored data with additional information to provide more context or value.
- Data is enriched by integrating external datasets, applying algorithms for data augmentation, or adding metadata. This
  enriched data provides deeper insights and improves the quality of analysis.

### Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics

- Apply advanced analytics techniques to predict future trends and recommend actions.
- Predictive models are built using historical data to forecast future trends. Prescriptive analytics provide
  recommendations based on these predictions to guide business strategies and decision-making.

### Data Sharing and Integration

- Share data with other systems or partners, and integrate it with other data sources for comprehensive analysis.
- Data is exported or shared with other systems or external partners. Integration with other data sources allows for a
  more holistic view and better-informed decisions.

### Compliance and Auditing

- Ensure that data handling practices comply with regulatory requirements and conduct audits.
- Data handling and storage practices are reviewed to ensure they meet regulatory standards. Regular audits are
  conducted to verify compliance and address any issues.

### Data Cleaning and Maintenance

- Periodically clean and maintain stored data to ensure its quality and relevance.
- Data is cleaned to remove duplicates, correct errors, and update outdated information. Maintenance tasks include
  optimizing storage and ensuring data integrity.
